# CommunRoom
My try on a dApp of a Commun Room for payable chat with Ethereum

# The idea
This is a smart contract for a chat room where you can obtain only one connection a accredit it with a certain value of "wei".
A message has a cost to sent, the connection can be transfered to other addresses. 
### Basically it is a log where you have your name. Maybe one day next to someome famous!

# The communication front-end
I had the idea to use TheGraph to query messages and then show them on whatever front-end you have instead of storing them on a state variable and accessing them through a view.

# Information
### The Commun Room contract is deployed and published on rinkeby and here is its address: 0xC6997309943680be3B57e8BB8cDcad96126B061e
### Here is TheGraph link:
